The funny bits are voice leading using the seventh of a chord as a common tone and modulation to the relative minor

That tune sat half-written for like half a year, and I might have never completed its accompanying part
if it wasn't for the birthday of a certain violinist who doubles as a harmony expert.
I picked this one from the pile of drafts because it had modulations to the dominant key—at least something to make
a decent gift for someone who knows much more about harmony than I do.

“Stray Cat Strut” by Brian Setzer.

The other idea was to write a piece that can be viewed as a jazz piece with an overly elaborate intro,
