This is my home page. I know home pages is not a popular genre these days and it probably makes me
look old fashioned.
</p>

<p>
Wait, I guess it wasn't a proper introduction. My name is <strong>Daniil Baturin</strong>. On the Internet I usually go by <strong>dmbaturin</strong>,
the &ldquo;m&rdquo; is from my middle name, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic">of sorts</a>.
The good thing about it is that it's easy to write in ASCII. The bad thing is that just about everyone asks how they should
pronounce it and how many i's are there. I don't really care, you can call me Dan and avoid the issue altogether.
<br/>
If you really insist, there are two i's and it's pronounced [Danʲiʔil Baturʲin], with a glottal stop between the i's like in &ldquo;uh-oh&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>I write programs and build networks. Sometimes those programs have something to do with networks,
   sometimes they don't.</p>
<p>You may know me as one of the maintainers of <a href="http://vyos.io">VyOS</a> network operating system,
   my biggest and most important project at this time.</p>

<p>You may be interested in my <a href="/projects">projects</a> or the
   <a href="/docs">documentation</a> I wrote. At least that's what I consider most important.</p>
