This is my home page. I know home pages is not a popular genre these days and it probably makes me
look old fashioned.
</p>

<h2>Whose home page?</h2>
<p>
My name is <strong>Daniil Baturin</strong>. On the Internet I usually go by <strong>dmbaturin</strong>,
the &ldquo;m&rdquo; is from my middle name, <wikipedia page="patronymic">of sorts</wikipedia>.
The good thing about it is that it's easy to write in ASCII. The bad thing is that just about everyone asks how they should
pronounce it and how many i's are there. Myself I don't care, you can call me Dan and avoid the issue altogether.
<br/>
If you really insist, there are two i's and it's pronounced [Danʲiʔil Baturʲin] (Dah-nee-ee-l Bah-too-ree-n, with a glottal stop between the i's like in &ldquo;uh-oh&rdquo;).
</p>

<p>
I write programs and build networks. Sometimes those programs have something to do with networks,
sometimes they don't. I'm also an occasional technical writer, freelance tech journalist,
amateur clarinetist and composer, and a personification of the nerd stereotype.
</p>

<p>You may be interested in my <a href="/projects">projects</a> or the
   <a href="/docs">documentation</a> I wrote. At least that's what I consider most important.</p>
<p>
The ones that are used widely enough that you might have already stumbled upon them are
<a href="https://www.vyos.io">VyOS</a> (a GNU/Linux distribution for routers), <a href="/tools/encapcalc">encapcalc</a>
the MTU/MSS calculator, and the <a href="/docs/iproute2">task-centered iproute2 user guide</a>
(formerly &ldquo;iproute2 cheatsheet&rdquo;).

I'm committed to improving accessibility. The pages render fine in text-only web browsers 
such as <a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m</a> and <a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">lynx</a>
and seem to work fine with a screen reader. If you are an accessibility technology user and you've found an
issue, let me know.
</p>
<p>
Accessibility and support for outdated software are different issues though.
Despite its visual simplicity, this website is not made with outdated web browsers in mind,
though anything released after 2013 should work.

<h2>News</h2>
<p>
The usual problem with news sections on static websites is that no one ever updates them. For this reason I made a dirty hack
for generating them from the git commit log.
