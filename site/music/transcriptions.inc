<h3>Gigue by Jean-Mari Leclair (clarinet and piano)</h3>

<p>
It was typeset from an old handwritten copy and I have no idea which opus it may be from since I couldn't find the original violin version on IMSLP
or elsewhere, or even if it's really Leclair (though the stye is consistent with his other works).
Regardless, it's a pretty, even if challenging piece.

<h3>Sunrise Song</h3>

<p>An oboe piece by Sergey Vasilenko, a soviet composer (the original russian title is &ldquo;Песня на рассвете&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Note that this piece is most likely <strong>not</strong> in the public domain since Sergey Vasilenko died in 1956.
   I have no idea who you should talk to if you want to license it. It's a nice piece though and I'll rather push the limits of
   fair use to spread it.</p>
