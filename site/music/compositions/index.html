<h1>Compositions</h1>

<p>My fully-notated compositions, mostly in the neo-classical and neo-baroque styles.</p>
<p>I notate all my music using MuseScore, which is free and open-source. You can download it from <a href="https://musescore.org/">musescore.org</a>.</p>
<p>The audio files are also generated by MuseScore, but I hope to replace them with live recordings some day.</p>
