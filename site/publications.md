# Publications and talks

## Computer magazine articles

### Hack Mag / «Хакер»

The Hacker Magazine («Хакер» in Russian) is the oldest Russian magazine on information security.
Since ca. 2015 it's only published online, but back in my high school days our group of nerds
used to subscribe to the paper version.

Articles in the Hacker Magazine (in Russian): [xakep.ru/author/dmbaturin](https://xakep.ru/author/dmbaturin/).

Articles in HackMag, the English version of it: [hackmag.com/author/daniilbaturin](https://hackmag.com/author/daniilbaturin/).

**Note:** Articles in the English version are translations from Russian made by the magazine staff.
I'm not responsible for translation quality of accuracy!

### Linux Format

#### Simpler firewalls with IPset

Published in the [issue 193](http://www.linuxformat.com/archives?issue=193) (January 2015).

Available to subscribers. Walks the reader through configuration of IPset, a tool that allows using groups of
hosts, networks, and ports in iptables rules.

These days, [nftables](https://nftables.org) offers native support for sets, so that article is largely obsolete.
