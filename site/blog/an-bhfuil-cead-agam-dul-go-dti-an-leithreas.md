# An bhfuil cead agam dul go dtí an leithreas? — a primer on Irish syntax

Some claim that <em>An bhfuil cead agam dul go dtí an leithreas?</em> (May I go to the toilet?)
is often the only phrase that people remember from their Irish lessons in school,
and some use it to prank people unfamiliar with the language by claiming that it's how you say
&ldquo;You will forever be in my heart&rdquo; or similar.
However, that phrase actually makes an excellent illustration of the basic Irish morphology and syntax,
so let's examine it in detail.
</p>

Obligatory disclaimer: I'm not actually a linguist, I just play one on the Internet,
so things I say may not be fully correct.

That phrase is pronounced more or less like this: [ɔn wilʲ cʲad əgɔm dɔl go dʲi: ən lʲehrʲas].

One thing of note is that many sources, like the [Wikipedia article on Irish phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_phonology),
put the velarization sign (ˠ) on every consonant that isn't palatalized.
I don't know why — the _n_ in the Irish _an_ doesn't sound any more velar to me than that in the English indefinite article "an".
It may be just to remind the reader that there's a systematic contrast between palatalized and velarized consonants in Irish
or to mess with their eyes.
In any case, if no one minds, I will use that sign only when there's clearly audible and semantically significant velarization,
like in _cill_ [cʲillʲ] (church) versus _coill_ [cˠillʲ] (forest). 

We will go from the end. _Leithreas_ [lʲehrʲəs] means "toilet". I'm pretty sure it's cognate with "latrine" — but I'll save
the discussion of reasons for this guess for my upcoming article on Irish phonology and pronunciation.

_An_ in _an leithreas_ is the definite article, so _an leithreas_ is "the toilet". There is no indefinite article in Irish,
for better or worse. The article "an" is also used for both feminine and masculine nouns, but you still need to know the noun gender
to use it correctly. The reason is that in feminine nouns, it triggers an [initial consonant mutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant_mutation).
Specifically, it triggers lenition (_séimhiú_) — a mutation that, generally, turns occlusives into fricatives.

For example, suppose you want to go to a more pleasant place — the kitchen. The Irish for kitchen is _cistin_ [kʲiʃtʲinʲ] and it's a feminine noun,
so with the definite article, it would be _an chistin_ [xʲiʃtʲinʲ].

_Go dtí_ [go di:] is "to". It's largely a fossilized form, so we will not dwell on it too much. This form is commonly used when the noun has something in front of it,
like a possessive pronoun of the definite article. If it doesn't, "to" is usually just _go_: _go Corcaigh_ (to Cork), _go Luimneach_ (to Limerick), and so on.

_Dul_ is a verbal noun that means (the act of) "going".. Its verb is _téigh_ — the dictionary form of the verb is normally the second person present tense imperative.
You can look up its other forms in a [dictionary](https://www.teanglann.ie/en/gram/t%c3%a9igh).
Thankfully, not so many verbs in Irish are _that_ irregular. However, some are irregular in ways that don't have equivalents in other languages,
as we'll see a bit later. Verbal nouns are incredibly widely used in Irish compared to many other Indo-European languages.
For example, they are used to express the progressive aspect: "are you going to the toilet?" would be _an bhfuil tú ag dul go dtí an leithreas?_.

Now let's examine the _cead agam_ part. _Cead_ is the Irish for "permission". In a Germanic language like English or German, you normally use
modal verbs to talk about permissions, obligations, and similar concepts: "I may go", "I must go", and so on. Irish is strangely devoid of modal verbs
and those ideas are expressed with nouns instead: you say that you have permission, or love, or hate for something.

You may be worried that we are almost done with the sentence and we still haven't found the pronoun "I" in it. Well, it's because there's no pronoun in that sentence.
Irish has [inflected prepositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflected_preposition) that change for number and person.
_Agam_ is "at-me". The base form of it is _ag_. If your hypothetical friend Seán wants to go to the toilet but he's too afraid to ask,
you can do it for him like this: _an bhfuil cead ag Seán dul go dtí an leithreas?_.
Check out the [dictionary entry for "ag"](https://www.teanglann.ie/en/gram/ag) and you'll see its seven inflected forms.

Now let's examine the remaining words: _an bhfuil_ [ɔn wilʲ]. Let me say up front that _bhfuil_ is the verb in that sentence.
More specifically, it's a form of the verb _bí_ — the Irish for "be". Again, not for "to be" — there are no infinitives in Irish.
_Bí_ is a second person imperative that could be used in a phrase like _bí linn!_ ("[you a single person,] be with us!").
Things get funny from there.

That _an_ is not the same as _an_ in _an leithreas_. _An_ in _an leithreas_ is the definite article. Since _bhfuil_ is a verb,
it cannot come with an article, right? Indeed, that _an_ is a completely different word that just happens to look the same.
In that context, it's a _preverbal particle_ that is used for questions. Another preverbal particle is _nach_ [nax]:
_nach bhfuil cead agam dul go dtí an leithreas?_ would mean "don't I have permission to go to the toilet?".

So, suppose the person you are asking grants you permission to go to the toilet. What would the answer sound like?
In its fullest possible form, it's going to be _tá cead agat dul go dtí an leithreas_. In the real speech, it's probably going to be
_tá cead agat_ or just _tá_.

Like all Insular Celtic languages, Irish is a [VSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb%E2%80%93subject%E2%80%93object_word_order)
(verb-subject-object) language. The verb always comes first. So, _tá_ is a verb — and it's another form of the verb _bí_.

The reason is that in Irish, some verbs have distinct forms for use with preverbal particles. Such forms are called "dependent forms".
The present tense dependent form of "bí" that is used in statements is "tá". The dependent form is, technically, _fuil_.
However, preverbal particles trigger mutations so you never actually see that pure form: it's either _an/nach bhfuil_
or _níl_. _Níl_ is technically _ní_ (a negative particle) plus _fhuil_ — _fuil_ with the "f" rendered silent by lenition.

I can't promise that this knowledge will open the doors of every toilet in Ireland for you, but it certainly will not hurt.
