<h1>RedHat Linux 7.3 (2002)</h1>

<p>RedHat Linux 7.3 was released in 2002. Internet access in most places was still slow,
   so it was easier and cheaper to buy a CD or copy it from a friend than download it.</p>
<p>Package repositories as we know them today didn't exist yet, although there was an update
   utility and RedHat Network existed already, installing a package from a remote
   source in one command was not possible.</p>
<p>Anyway, let's just look at screenshots from the past.</p>

<p>Loading the CD takes us to the installer.</p>

<p>Hardware configuration and partitionining aren't all that interesting.
   What is more interesting is that back then installers usually didn't install a
   set of packages selected by the distro maintainers, but asked you what you want
   to install, up to individual packages.</p>

<p>Now just watch the progress bar.</p>

<p>Well, until the installer asks us to insert the next CD.</p>

<p>The installer tries to keep us entertained.</p>

<p>Maybe it's not a very health conscious advice, but they have a point.
   At the time, OS installation could easily take a couple of hours
   on average hardware.</p>

<p>With modern hardware, we don't have to wait so long of course.</p>

<p>When floppy drives are ubiquitous, a rescue floppy is quite a useful thing.</p>

<p>Time to reboot.</p>
<a href="rh73_grub_00.png"> <img src="preview/rh73_grub_00.png" alt="GRUB splash screen" /> </a>

<p>Graphical boot didn't exist at the time.</p>
<a href="rh73_boot.png"> <img src="preview/rh73_boot.png" alt="Boot messages" /> </a>

<p>Finally we are at the login screen.</p>
<a href="rh73_login_screen.png"> <img src="preview/rh73_login_screen.png" alt="GDM login screen" /> </a>

<p>GNOME 1.4. Back then it would take some time to load and had a load progress screen,
   but now it loads too fast to easily make a screenshot of it.</p>

<p>Those days I preferred KDE though. This is 3.0.0.</p>
<a href="rh73_kde_desktop.png"> <img src="preview/rh73_kde_desktop.png" alt="Empty KDE desktop" /> </a>

<p>Lots of settings.</p>
<a href="rh73_kde_control_center.png"> <img src="preview/rh73_kde_control_center.png" alt="KDE control center" /> </a>

<p>It could even cosplay CDE, in a rather convincing way.</p>

<p>Binary packages for distros that old are hard to find, and finding and building old source tarballs is hardly worth
   the time, but we can look at some of the software included in the installation CDs.</p>

<p>AbiWord 0.99.5.</p>
<a href="rh73_abiword.png"> <img src="preview/rh73_abiword.png" alt="AbiWord version screen" /> </a>

<p>Mostly works, not with ODF and post-2000 MS Word format of course. Also, default fonts look awful.</p>

<p>Some things, like gnuplot's default colors, stayed the same for many years.</p>

<p>Ethereal before it was Wireshark.</p>
<a href="rh73_ethereal.png"> <img src="preview/rh73_ethereal.png" alt="Traffic dump of pinging redhat.com displayed in Ethereal" /> </a>

<p>KGhostView still displays PDFs pretty much fine. There was Acrobat Reader too, I don't remember if it was any better.</p>
<a href="rh73_pdf_viewer.png"> <img src="preview/rh73_pdf_viewer.png" alt="A research paper from arxiv.org opened in KGhostView" /> </a>

<p>Python 1.5.</p>
<a href="rh73_python_kde.png"> <img src="preview/rh73_python_kde.png" alt="A simple Python code example in the REPL" /> </a>

<p>OCaml 3.06. The binary package somehow survived on an INRIA FTP site.</p>
<a href="rh73_ocaml.png"> <img src="preview/rh73_ocaml.png" alt="A simple OCaml code example in the REPL" /> </a>

<p>Mozilla 0.9.9. Still renders some websites sort of correctly.</p>
<a href="rh73_mozilla099.png"> <img src="preview/rh73_mozilla099.png" alt="kernel.org website displayed in Mozilla" /> </a>

<p>Well, only some of them. Most are beyond any recognition.</p>
<a href="rh73_mozilla_redhat.png"> <img src="preview/rh73_mozilla_redhat.png" alt="redhat.com website displayed in Mozilla, very incorrectly" /> </a>

<p>Still it's better than Netscape. I couldn't find a single modern (not archived) website it would still
   be able to render.</p>
<a href="rh73_netscape.png"> <img src="preview/rh73_netscape.png" alt="arxiv.org website displayed in Netscape incorrectly" /> </a>

<p>If you want to install it yourself, images are still available from a number of servers, e.g. from
   <a href="https://archive.org/details/redhat-7.3_release">archive.org/details/redhat-7.3_release</a>.
   Works fine in VirtualBox, just don't use a SATA controller (SATA didn't exist at the time), IDE or SCSI
   should be fine. Mouse integration and the like obviously don't work, VirtualBox itself also didn't
   exist at the time.</p>
