<h1>Software reviews</h1>

<p>Software reviews, so to speak. Except the software is historical or uncommon.
   In other words, software you are unlikely to have seen, and probably unlikely to want to see.</p>

<h3>A note on copyrights</h3>

<p>I assume that screenshots of software inherit the copyright from that software.
   In case of non-free software, I believe distributing screenshots is fair use, as vieweing screenshots cannot replace using the
   software, and therefore cannot affect its value.</p>
<p>If you are a copyright holder and you think otherwise, please contact me.</p>
